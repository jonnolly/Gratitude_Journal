Then waking up, having my wellness routine and having clean clothes, affirmations, my amazing life, gratitude, sight reading, visualising 251s, journalling. I feel good. I feel like i am living ""my amazing life"" right now. I'm so grateful for giving myself this life.

I'm grateful for my kindle. I am grateful for jorge for pointing me towards this. It is so interesting reading about people in twin oaks community. It is igniting a fire in my belly for communal living.

I'm grateful to myself for sticking at this sober life for long enough to get to this point. What progress I have made in my life to get to the point of pursuing music as a part of my 9-5. I am so grateful to myself and to the conditions necessary for my own realisation and actualisation."
